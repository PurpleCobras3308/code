# Repo Structure
The home directory has the app's HTML and CSS files, and the directories *sql*, *scripts*, *exp*, and *EXP-Functional*. The functional part of the app consists of these HTML/CSS files and the code in *EXP-Functional*, which contains both the sql code we ended up using and the javascript that makes up the middle layer.
