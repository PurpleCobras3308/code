# Concept
The Study Buddy web app allows students to create a profile, store the classes they're taking and availability, and search for other students taking the same classes in order to find study buddies. The profile/class info is stored in a SQL database that is displayed on HTML pages using Javascript. 

# Repo Structure
The home directory has the app's HTML and CSS files, the test plan pdf, and the directories *sql*, *scripts*, *exp*, and *EXP-Functional*. The functional part of the app consists of these HTML/CSS files and the code in *EXP-Functional*, which contains both the SQL code we ended up using and the Javascript that makes up the middle layer. 

# Build
No compilation necessary.

# Usage
